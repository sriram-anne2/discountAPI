# discountAPI
Spring boot REST APIs that allow a user to find the best applicable discount given items purchased

Requirements:

• The system stores discounts and determines the best discount for a given set of items
• An item has three properties: its id, its cost, and its type
• There are three types of discounts: by item type, by total cost of items, by count of a particular item
• The discount is applied via a percentage. For example, all items of type X are 15% off. Each discount has a corresponding Code
• Multiple discounts may apply but the system should select the best discount for the customer. Respond with the best discount code and with the total cost of the items after applying the discount.
• The system should expose an API to add a new discount
• The system should expose an API to remove an existing discount
• The system should expose an API to calculate the best discount for a given set of items
